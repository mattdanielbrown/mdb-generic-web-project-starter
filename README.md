#MDB Generic Web Project Starter
My personal, general-purpose starting template for web development.

## Contents


### The Obvious

Obviously, there's an index.html, stylesheets, and javascript...

### CSS Preprocessors

Currently, this starting template uses SASS, and the Bourbon mixin library. Alternatively, it's easy to simply delete the Partials and the SCSS folders in favor of using straight CSS.

### Reset Stylesheet

Included is the Reset Stylesheet by Eric Meyer to reduce browser inconsistencies.

### Javascript

The latest stable jQuery library is included as the main javascript library.

### Modernizr

Modernizr is used to detect old browsers, touch devices, devices without support for javascript, and add CSS accordingly.
